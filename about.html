		<p>Audio blanket is a live audio visual show/experience using cutting edge proffesional dj equipment and state of the art lighting for an immersive experience. Playing a blend of chill edm, orchestral, ambient and original music the audio is mixed in a way that engages the senses.The music is accompanied by spoken word and philosophy from some of our worlds greatest minds both past and present. <br>
		A finely tuned video is projected and played alongside the audio in high definition with dramatic scenes and beautiful colors. As the video evolves and changes along with the audio, the lighting effects vary and evolve along side of it.</p>
